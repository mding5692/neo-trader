/**
 * The sizer object for the [[boxCalc]] function.
 *
 * A box sizer holds the geometry information for an object along the
 * layout orientation. An array of box sizers representing a line of
 * objects is passed to [[boxCalc]] along with the amount of space
 * available for layout. The algorithm will update the [[size]] of
 * each box sizer with its computed size.
 *
 * #### Notes
 * For best performance, this class should be treated as a raw data
 * struct. It should not typically be subclassed.

/**
 * Compute the optimal layout sizes for an array of box sizers.
 *
 * This distributes the available layout space among the box sizers
 * according to the following algorithm:
 *
 * 1. Initialize the sizers's size to its size hint and compute the
 *    sums for each of size hint, min size, and max size.
 *
 * 2. If the total size hint equals the available space, return.
 *
 * 3. If the available space is less than the total min size, set all
 *    sizers to their min size and return.
 *
 * 4. If the available space is greater than the total max size, set
 *    all sizers to their max size and return.
 *
 * 5. If the layout space is less than the total size hint, distribute
 *    the negative delta as follows:
 *
 *    a. Shrink each sizer with a stretch factor greater than zero by
 *       an amount proportional to the negative space and the sum of
 *       stretch factors. If the sizer reaches its min size, remove
 *       it and its stretch factor from the computation.
 *
 *    b. If after adjusting all stretch sizers there remains negative
 *       space, distribute the space equally among the sizers with a
 *       stretch factor of zero. If a sizer reaches its min size,
 *       remove it from the computation.
 *
 * 6. If the layout space is greater than the total size hint,
 *    distribute the positive delta as follows:
 *
 *    a. Expand each sizer with a stretch factor greater than zero by
 *       an amount proportional to the postive space and the sum of
 *       stretch factors. If the sizer reaches its max size, remove
 *       it and its stretch factor from the computation.
 *
 *    b. If after adjusting all stretch sizers there remains positive
 *       space, distribute the space equally among the sizers with a
 *       stretch factor of zero. If a sizer reaches its max size,
 *       remove it from the computation.
 *
 * 7. return
 *
 * @param sizers - The sizers for a particular layout line.
 *
 * @param space - The available layout space for the sizers.
 *
 * #### Notes
 * This function can be called at any time to recompute the layout
 * sizing for an existing array of sizers. The previously computed
 * results will have no effect on the new output. It is therefore
 * not necessary to create new sizers on each resize event.
